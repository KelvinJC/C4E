Why use pointers?

1. 
Since variables are passed by value,
in the case where a main function passes its variables to a defined function,
if the variables are modified within the function
what has been modified is a value copy of the variable 
not the variable's value itself.
To address the need for a function to change the actual variable and not its copy 
(as is the case when the variable is passed by value)
we use pointers to pass the memory addresses of the variable into the function. 
In this way, any change the function makes is on the actual value of the variable

2. 
Functions in C cannot return multiple variables.

To address the need for the effect of a function on a set of variables 
to persist beyond the runtime of the function 

the workaround for that is to pass the memory addresses of the different 
variables into the function. In this way, the function can modify the value 
of the variables and the modification is made to the actual variable
