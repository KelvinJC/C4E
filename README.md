<h1>C</h1> 

My journey learning C was inspired by Dr. Chuck after watching this interview on David Bombal's youtube channel.

Studying the "classic" version of the C Programming language from the 1978 book written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (inventor of C)
through the C for Everybody course by Prof. Charles (Chuck) Severance.

The course is available on www.cc4e.com.

I highly recommend this path.
